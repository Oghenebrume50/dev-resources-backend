# Rusty's Resources - Backend
The aim of this project is to create a web app that will display all of the student submitted resources, from the #dev-resources channel and potentially other channels on the ZTM Discord server. A Discord bot will be responsible for automatically adding new resources to a database, with the possibility of manually triggering the addition of new resources from other channels.

An independant bot that alongside the functionality of detecting and submitting resources to the database, will provide the backend and API for the frontend to produce a feature rich resource sharing platform for the Zero To Mastery community.

### **The resources bot will be responsible for:**

#### üîó Automatic Link Submission üîó
Upon automatically detecting and validating a link only in the #dev-resources channel on Discord, the bot should:

- Collect data for the link such as: Title, Desc, Thumbnail and any other relevant infromation from the links meta data. [See this npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/url-metadata)
- Collect the submitters details, such as: Discord username, avatar, etc.
- Save all the data to the database
- If suceessfully saved, return an embed, containing the information collected. This will serve as confirmation the data was saved, and a asthetically pleasiing, unified format for sharing the resource with others. The embed should also contain a link to view it on the front-end web app. 
- If sucessfully saved, the users original message should be deleted. If saving failed, it should be kept and perhaps a error should be raised so it can be looked into/fixed.

#### ‚òëÔ∏è :link: Manual Link Submission ‚òëÔ∏è
Fantastic resources are often posted in various channels around the Discord server, as the bot is only pro-actively looking to add links in the #Dev-Resources, theses resources will soon be lost. 
Therefore the bot should have a command that will do the following, when a specified emoji, is used on a message containing a link:

- Collect the links meta data (As above)
- Collect the submitters details
- Save all data to the database
- If successful, return the embed to the resources channel
- Leave the original message in tact.

#### ‚ôªÔ∏è Remove Posts Without Links ‚ôªÔ∏è
Any post in the channel that does not contain a valid link, should be instantly removed from the channel and inform the user why this occured via DM. 

---

#### üìã API and Request Handling üìã
The bot should provide an API along with brief documentation for the front end to interact with.

- View all resources
